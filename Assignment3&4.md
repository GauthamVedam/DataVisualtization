## Data Viz Chosen: 

Article: [OECD Household Income rise in OECD](http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/)

![](/VizChosen.JPG)

This Vizualization explains importance of Policy making especially during the pandemic. The high volatility currently affecting overall levels of household income in OECD countries reflects the extent to which fiscal policy responses can vary by amount and duration, policies which remain essential during the ongoing pandemic.

The viz shows that Household income rose in 2020 Q2 while GDP per capita decreased and continues to grow in 2020 Q3 while the GDP bounces back.

## Critique:

**Things that I noticed first**:

* The trend line for income and bar charts have varying directions in 2020.
* The red bars draw a lot of attention to them and to the fact that there is a decrease in 2020 Q2.

**What I like:**

* Simple layout clearly showing two varying trends with a clear differentiation to show how an event like policy change affects them.
* Contrasting color schemes to clearly differentiate between the two. 

**What I disliked:**

* The X asis labels on top make it harder to get an idea of which quarter the shift has started
* I found myself glancing many times at the legend to see what the blue line is and the red bars are
* A lot of space is occupied by the red bars which adds too much color and takes attention away from highligting the gap in 2020 Q3. 

**What I would change:** 

* Move Y axis labels to a more conventional bottom placement.
* Move legend nearer to the lines to aid clarity.
* Change the bars color to something less attention grabbing. 
* Consider changing the chart type to draw more attention to the trend. 
* Change the starting year from 2000 to 2010 since the extra data adds a lot of information that is unnecessary. 

**Stephen Few's Efectiveness Profile:**

* Completeness:   9
* Perceptability: 6
* Truthfulness:   9

## Redesigning: 

### Wireframe:

### Redesigned Viz first Attempt:

FeedBack from friend 1: 

* A lot of empty space below 70 since there are no values there.
* Color selection gives more importance to Household Income. 

Feedback from friend 2: 

* The title doesnot suggest what casued the change in Household income. 
* Lines squashed together, can be separated better.
* GDP seems faded out due to lighter color. 


### Redesign After feedback: 



**Household income increases in 2020 Q3 despite Fall in GDP due to Policy Changes.**

## The Process: 

From the critique process above, It is clear that what needs to be improved are **Perceptability, Intuitiveness and Aesthetics.**  For the wireframes thats what I mainly focused on, trying to convey what the data are trying to tell in a simpler and clearer way. The different types of textures like bars and lines were distracting from identifying the increase in Household income inspite of decline in GDP. So I changed both of the categories to a line to convey the trend and gap between them better. 

After incorporating the feedback, the viz is now more zoomed in to avoid excess space and the title conveys now that policy change cause the increase in household income. 

I found this critique method very intuitve and easier to focus on what needs to be imporved and more importantly, compare the redesigned viz with the original in the same categories to see if there is any improvement.
