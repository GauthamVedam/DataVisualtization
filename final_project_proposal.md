## Project Proposal: 

## 1. Outline: 

For my final project, I wanted to focus on Chroic Diseases in the United States. I want to tell a visual story which will make my audience understand how bad the current situation is and the consequences of being ignorant towards these conditions.

Chronic diseases in the US is a serious problem with every 6 out of 10 people having some chronic condition, which will over time cost a lot in terms of money and the quality of life. I want to draw attention to the most common Chronic diseases and make an attempt to understand their causes. 

A basic outline of my priject would look like:

* What are Chronic Diseases and are they serious?
* How many people are affected and why you should care.
* The leading causes of chronic diseases
* How can they be prevented?

Most importantly, I want to highlight a few simple changes that we can make to our lifestyle which go a long way in preventing these conditions and significantly improve our lives. 
To summarize, I want my audience to be aware of the **seriousness and scale of Chroic Diseases** and the irony of how **very small changes can lead to exceptional returns.** 



## 2. Initial Sketches: 

## 3. Data: 

[The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm) has all the information related to chronic diseases from images, inforgraphics, and datasets related to chronic diseases in the US. 

This data along with articles and studies related to the topic will account for most of the data and images which I will use in my project. 

## 4. Method and Medium: 

This project will be completed in 3 phases: 

### Phase 1: 

  * Conduct research and gain a thorough understanding of the topic
  * Finalizing on the key points that I want to convey to my audience. 
  * Create a story arc of emotions that I want my audience to feel as they go through my work.
  * Gather the related data and articles 
  * User Feedback on story arc and any suggestions on what they want to include
  * Initial Sketches of the vizualizations

### Phase 2:
  * Understand and decide on a color theme for the final project. 
  * Create wireframes for vizualiaztions from the initial sketches
  * Iterative user feedback until satisfaction
  * Creating the vizualizations using Tableau, Flourish etc. 
  * Refining and tweaking the vizualizations
  
###  Phase 3:
 * Using Shorthand to put it all together
 * Get feedback if the story is effective conveyed. 
 * Focus on how convincing the Call to Action is. 
 * Presentation to the class
 
 
As listed above, I will be using **Shortand** to present my work and for data vizualizations, I will be using **Tableau and RawGraphs.**
