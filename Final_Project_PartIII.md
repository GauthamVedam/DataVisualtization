## Final Project Part III:

As I intended in Part 1 of this project, I wanted my readers to understand the seriousness of chronic diseases and how common they are. Accordingly I focused on these main areas

* What are Chronic Diseases and are they serious?
* How many people are affected and why you should care.
* The Costs of Chronic diseases
* The leading causes of chronic diseases
* How to prevent them

Through the iterative process of feedback based modilfications, I developed clear vizualizations to support the messsage that I wanted to convey.
One particular feedback that I could not include in my project was to include a story, not just facts about Chronic diseases. After spending a lot of time on it, I was convinced that although the scope is quite broad, I wanted to show that this is a serious issue. 

After finishing the project, I realized a natural progression towards a more specific topic **Successful Interventions for Chronic Diseases**. Interventions are supposed to be the future of healthcare and a major area of focus for pharmaceutical firms and insurance providers alike. 
Hence, I will expand on this introduction to Chronic Diseases to show the current state and future of Clinical Interventions, in a sequel to this project. 

Coming back to this project, I used vizualizations which were the most simple and effective to convey the message I inteded to convey, like bar charts, pie charts etc. 

Some of the vizualizations I used in my final project are: 

**US adults with chronic diseases by number of chronic diseases**

The tools I used for the vizualizations were Flourish studio and DataWrapper. To publish my story I used Shorthand. All these tools were very new to me, since I have mostly used python packages like Matplotlib and Seaborn for all my vizualization needs.
