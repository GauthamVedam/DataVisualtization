# DataVisualtization

## About me: 

I am a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University. This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data class in Spring 2021. 
As I build up my data vizualization skills, this portfolio will be a good reminder of the progress that I made and learnings along the way. 

## What I hope to learn: 

At CMU,   my focus areas include leveraging Machine Learning in various applications, Distributed Systems, Database Design. I lack an artistic touch in my vizulizations and often produce charts that are just enough to convey the information that information that I want to. During this course, I hope to imporve my story telling skills along with knowing the fundamentals of a good vizualization and being able to produce some.  

I am aware that this course will be a challenging one for me, since I cannot code my way through this but I look forward to the challenge and excited for the learning ahead.
