## The Target Audience: 

My target audience are all American adults. In this part I have spent a long time trying to narrow down the scope based on the feedback from Part 1, but the story I want to tell is broad. It is about all the various conditions that affect american adults and what their affects are. I couldnt spend as much time into vizualizations and I am prepared to put in a lot more time in that area. At the end, I want my readers to be aware of how prevalant and serious chronic diseases are and how to prevent them with simple changes. 

## Representative Individuals: 

Since this is broad area, I want people from different age groups to be involved in my interview set ranging from university students to middle aged and older adults.
