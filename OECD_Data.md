## Summary

The three vizualizations shown above are variations of similar data with focus on same data shown in different ways. The first chart from OECD is a useful to comapre differnet countries Debt to GDP ratio in a single year, but it does not show how a country compares over different years. 

In the second chart i.e. Grid Line Chart, the trend of each country is clearly visible in the form of a line, while also being able to compare differnt countries in a grid. This can still become clumsy when trying to identify quick insights like which country has the highest ratio in a particular year. 

This issue is addressed in the final chart, where the focus is now only on the top 10 countries and how their ratio is changing year on year. The leader is always displahed on the top racing ahead of the other countries in a particular year which gives an intuitive way of identifying which year there is a spike or decline in a countries Debt to GDP ratio.
